{"tagline":"API Centric Node.js Blogging Framework","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"### Papernode\r\n\r\nPapernode strives to be a flexible, API-centric, easy to maintain blogging framework. Often, we run into the need to change things in the blogging engine or wish we could change the way things work under the covers and this is our answer. Many times in our web development, we have run into the need to have a blog running underneath a web application, but run into issues deciding how to inter-op with the blogging engine of choice such as WordPress or Drupal. Do we simply include a link? Do we maintain information in two places because we are unable to merge the two systems?\r\n\r\nWhat if we would like a personal touch to our own personal blogging engine that allows us to really blog the way we would like but are unable to because of the rigid architecture that is inherited with a large platform with many install steps that are easy to follow but equally as easy to break; taking hours in forum visits to debug?\r\n\r\nPapernode aims to solve these issues.  Currently, everything is built out from a central API which will be running the show. This allows us to provide a flexible way to access all of your data. Things to come include a CLI client, management pages, and plugins","google":"","name":"Papernode"}
